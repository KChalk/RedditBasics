I would love it if someone could explain the whole process just so I make sure I comprehend this properly, also I would like to know the downfalls of investing in something like this. The website from the person who sells products relating to this says it&amp;#39;s a no risk investment, which is a little hard to believe. If anyone has done this or has any stories/testimonials, please help a young entrepreneur make some smart investments. Thanks in advance for any help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1293943788,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I'm pretty depressed, probably at my lowest. Sorry if this is too long of a post, but i wanna get it all out.\n\nThis all started near last weekend. My main computer, a HP Laptop with Vista on it just died on me. I had it since 2007, but only heavily used it for the past 2 years. I wanted it to go to sleep, it froze and the screen showed this weird thing, kinda looked like one of those black and white optical illusion pictures. I thought it was just the laptop crashing and didn't think too much of it, until the next day when i tried to turn it on, and instead the power light came on, the insides started doing their thing, and then after a few seconds it blinked off again and restarted over and over again. It won't fully turn on and so now all my work and files are trapped on the hard drive (which i took out since when i can, i'm going to try and get the computer repaired) and now i have to use my old computer.\n\nMy old comp is a HP Desktop (i've learned to not go for HP stuff anymore since their helpline sucks and their comps have lots of problems) and its got Win XP and from 2002. It can't handle much which puts me in a bad spot. I'm trying to become a filmmaker and writer, and i was going to start filming and trying to earn some money from it this year. It was hard enough to do all my work on a laptop that was a bit behind, but i tried and tried and managed.\n\nWhen my laptop died, i decided to call my uncle. He and i are not exactly on good terms, so i didn't expect much, but the thing is i told him i would pay him back a bit every month, and my mom offered to give him her computer which is perfect for what he needs. Lately he's wanted to get himself a computer and he's an old fashioned person so he doesn't really understand new technology and computers and stuff. All he wants to get a computer for is to download music and watch movies on. He kept asking me all these past few months what computer he should get, and i don't think its just me but i was feeling like he was trying to spite me or whatever, saying he won't help get me a new computer which i would use for work purposes, but he wants me to help him get a computer that has so many features that he doesn't need and would never use. It drives me insane.\n\nHe's quite mean too because he never gives me a straight answer. He'll say \"i'll see\" and leave me hanging for a month, all the while asking for me to help him which i do and it never pays off. I don't even like saying that i'm asking him for help because i'll be giving him a computer and paying him back every month, so all he's really doing is just loaning me money.\n\nAnyway, before you say \"How come you don't get a job\", let me tell you that i would if i could, but i live with my mother (i'm 21) and she has some bad health issues. I take care of her and until i know she's in a safe place and i can leave her on her own, i just can't get a job. She supported me my whole life and when my dad passed away back in 2001, she was going through a lot but did her best. I find it only fair that now i do my best to support her, even if it means that people think i'm lazy and stay home all the time. I try to explain the truth to some people but then i realized i don't have to explain myself to anyone because its my business.\n\nSo today, my mother, the uncle i asked for help, and 2 other family members were going to get together for New Years. One of my family members cancelled out, and so i called the uncle to tell him and then asked if he was going to help me get a computer. He said no, because i had never shown him respect (which is hilarious to me since he treated me like a kid my whole life) and that i never call him up and have conversations over the phone with him, something he asked me to do since i was 6 years old and i honestly don't know any of my friends who call up their uncles for a chat, as i prefer to have a great conversation with a person face to face. The sick thing is whenever i try talking to him face to face, he always makes sick perverted jokes. Anyway, all i'm saying is, he tries so hard to get me to respect him when he doesn't treat me like an adult and he himself is overly immature.\n\nThe thing that got me depressed, is him saying he has no confidence in me what so ever. It kills. Its really hard to try and make a career out of something on your own, especially one that is filled with other people trying to do the same, and have no confidence or faith in you. I felt defeated today. I felt pointless and didn't even wanna think about my life goals anymore. The worst thing is i feel like i'm letting down my friend who was going to get into filming with me, and now he's waiting on me.\n\nI'm going to be saving up.. possibly 100 dollars a month.. because thats all i can really afford. Its going to take me a year to be able to get a computer that will handle the video editing i do. I'm confident in my skills.. but i just don't know how to cope with people not having faith in me.. it's really putting me down.. i'm sorry for this whole thing seeming like a rant. Maybe it is.. maybe i had to vent. Sorry for it being long, and if you read through it all, thanks.. it really means a lot to me. In my opinion i think it may make me sound like a crybaby who is depending on others for help, but i'm not.. i never expect help from anyone.

He is dating her best friend, so it was kind of a neat little group of 4 that would hang out and party and such. The only kicker was that I lived 2.5 hours away from the 3 of them. Basically, I would come down every so often (two or three times a month) to party with all of them and have sex with her. It was always a great time and well worth the effort and gas money to make the trip. We soon started texting each other every day which brought us a lot closer during the times I wasn't there. I finally decide that we should start dating, so there is no confusion over what is going on between us. She (kind of reluctantly) accepts under the condition that we don't try to make a lot of rules or be too serious about it. Nothing really changes for a while and all is well for a few more weeks.\n\n\n\n* Then shit changed. It basically seemed like she was no longer interested in dating me, but gave no signals toward a desire to break up. I tried not to notice and kept calling her and texting her as I had been doing previously, but now her responses are extremely delayed or nonexistent. Assuming she was really busy (it was finals time), I decided to see her over Thanksgiving break. What followed was one of the worst weekends of my life. Not only did she completely ignore my presence, but would actively show physical affection to one of her male friends when we were all hanging out. This made me furious, and upon leaving I demanded an explanation. All she would tell me was that she was going through something difficult mentally, that it wasn't me or my fault, and that she wouldn't go into details. I decide to give her another chance, but the next day the hurt was getting to me and I had to call her and end it. The part that upset me most about the break up was her apparent lack of emotion about the whole process, as if she was impartial. \n\n\n\n* So I go on with life in my town, trying hard to forget the pain she had caused me. This is going well until I realize Christmas/New Years were coming up and I was pretty much guaranteed to see her. The familiar pangs of sadness grew until my arrival and started to really fuck with me mentally upon actually seeing her. The past 3 days were spent in a drunken confusion/depression while I was for some reason subjecting myself to her presence with our 2 friends. It was just like the good old days, except I was miserable. \n\n\n\n* I finally decide that I will not feel better until I just take her aside and force her to tell me what the fuck had happened betwixt us. This works SURPRISINGLY well, and we actually had a great amount to talk about regarding the relationship. All details aside, I practically just got to sit there and tell her how bad she hurt me while she took it in stride and explained/apologized for each problem I had with her. After about 2 hours of talking, we are now closer than we were whilst dating and pretty much all of my angst and sadness is gone. I now know a lot of the ways I should approach her about things and just generally have a much better grasp on the way for us to get along.\n\n\n\n* The only thing is that now I fear I may like her again. I know that dating her would be a horrible idea considering the distance and phone-effort required to maintain it, so I really just want to somehow take things back to how they were before the burden of dating was involved. \n\n\n\n* At this point, its not certain she would be interested in this, but she definitely has shown a desire to be a friend and keep in touch. I will be seeing her again in a week or so with the other 2 friends, and don't know how to go about seeing if she is interested. The more important question though is: how dumb am I for trying to make this happen? Am I just setting myself up for another heartbreak? Is there any way to remove my feelings from the situation and just have friendly sex on occasion?\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**: Was having casual drunken sex with girl who lived 2 hours away. It turned into dating which led to me getting hurt and dumping her. We've since talked about it and are now just good friends. I want to have things the way they were before we were dating, but I fear I'm just making the same mistake again.\n\n\n\n* Sorry for the length of this post and its verbose nature, I'm really hungover and have no ability to get my point across elegantly.","domain":"self.relationship_advice","num_comments":5,"likes":null,"clicked":false,"thumbnail":"default","saved":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","ups":3,"approved_by":null,"score":2,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I met this girl through one of my best friends.

She had dedicated her existence to trying to get something for nothing. She has borrowed money from everyone in our family to the point that no one will help her any more. \n\nAt Thanksgiving she was over when she got a call that she was not allowed to come back home because she was cheating on her boyfriend whom she was living with at his mother's house. My sister has three kids, two of which are his. The two that are his, are living with him now but I did not have the heart to kick them on to the streets, more specifically I could not let my 11 year old niece be homeless.\n\nA few weeks back my sister finally got a graveyard job, so she is either gone or sleeping at all times, which has made me more like the mother of my niece.\n\nWith that said, I am in a marriage that in on the rocks currently, and we have two children of our own as well. We live in a three bedroom home and there is not room for another family. \n\nI told my sister that the stress of having her stay with us is causing more marital issues for my husband and I. My husband was actually going to move out recently, to which my sister responded excitedly that we could rent my house together. There was no thought of what I might being going through, or what a divorce would do to my children. She just saw it as an opportunity for her.\n\nSo I told her she needed to get her own place after Christmas, and I could not have been more clear. None the less, she has spent every penny of every paycheck she has received and not save a penny to get her own place. I can't give her the boot because of my niece, and the fact that I am 100% raising her at this point, and she would most certainly retaliate by not allowing me to see her any more, and probably would move in with come crack head she knows. \n\nIN SHORT: How do I get my sister the fuck out of my house, and not risk more trauma to my niece, who has already changed more schools than grades and has been abused her whole life, and is for once experiencing stability and love?\n\nEDIT---I just want to add, I am the little sister. I am still in college as is my husband...We have the means to care for the kids (including hers of course) and ourselves. She gets state benefits to \"support herself and her kids\", and we don't qualify for any. She is abusing her food stamps on energy drinks, potato chips and chewing gum...\n\nEDIT 2---Yes I see my grammar mistake, title should read \"there ARE kids involved\", not really the issue, and thank you for your concerns for my grammar. My college thanks you.\n\nEDIT---Just talked to her and she was apparently under the impression that she was staying until school was out in May??? Last we talked I told her to get out after Christmas. She's not going to allow my niece to stay cause she said she was going to get a random on call babysitter for her, and apparently change her school again...when she could stay here for free and stay in the same school. She is so dumb. I told her that I hate the decisions she makes for she daughter, and that I feel sorry for my niece. I am so shaking mad right now. \n~People, if you are going to have children, be prepared to make some really tough decisions in their best interest.

The two that are his, are living with him now but I did not have the heart to kick them on to the streets, more specifically I could not let my 11 year old niece be homeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back my sister finally got a graveyard job, so she is either gone or sleeping at all times, which has made me more like the mother of my niece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, I am in a marriage that in on the rocks currently, and we have two children of our own as well. We live in a three bedroom home and there is not room for another family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my sister that the stress of having her stay with us is causing more marital issues for my husband and I. My husband was actually going to move out recently, to which my sister responded excitedly that we could rent my house together. There was no thought of what I might being going through, or what a divorce would do to my children. She just saw it as an opportunity for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I told her she needed to get her own place after Christmas, and I could not have been more clear. None the less, she has spent every penny of every paycheck she has received and not save a penny to get her own place. I can&amp;#39;t give her the boot because of my niece, and the fact that I am 100% raising her at this point, and she would most certainly retaliate by not allowing me to see her any more, and probably would move in with come crack head she knows. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IN SHORT: How do I get my sister the fuck out of my house, and not risk more trauma to my niece, who has already changed more schools than grades and has been abused her whole life, and is for once experiencing stability and love?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT---I just want to add, I am the little sister. I am still in college as is my husband...We have the means to care for the kids (including hers of course) and ourselves. She gets state benefits to &amp;quot;support herself and her kids&amp;quot;, and we don&amp;#39;t qualify for any. She is abusing her food stamps on energy drinks, potato chips and chewing gum...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2---Yes I see my grammar mistake, title should read &amp;quot;there ARE kids involved&amp;quot;, not really the issue, and thank you for your concerns for my grammar. My college thanks you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT---Just talked to her and she was apparently under the impression that she was staying until school was out in May??? Last we talked I told her to get out after Christmas. She&amp;#39;s not going to allow my niece to stay cause she said she was going to get a random on call babysitter for her, and apparently change her school again...when she could stay here for free and stay in the same school. She is so dumb. I told her that I hate the decisions she makes for she daughter, and that I feel sorry for my niece. I am so shaking mad right now. \n~People, if you are going to have children, be prepared to make some really tough decisions in their best interest. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1293941597,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

I had heard horror stories of the withdrawals, but I didn&amp;#39;t notice much out of the ordinary. Maybe that&amp;#39;s a testament to how much it wasn&amp;#39;t doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;m actually kind of liking the idea of staying off medications, and I&amp;#39;m not willing to go through the &amp;quot;you won&amp;#39;t feel anything for a few weeks&amp;quot; BS that comes with these drugs. Aside from going back to working out daily, I&amp;#39;m looking at taking supplements that are precursors to dopamine and serotonin, and fill my diet with natural foods that are naturally high in these chemicals. Which ones have worked for you all? I&amp;#39;ve read a number of lists and my favorites have been SAM-E, Omega 3 fish oils, and alot of spinach. I&amp;#39;ve read good things about 5HTP as a serotonin precursor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: I tried two different anti-depressants and neither worked. How many different meds did you try, or did you just give up with it? What natural supplements and foods work the best for you to help your mood&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","created":1293941255,"hidden":false,"over_18":false}

My girlfriend got on my case about it recently so I thought I'd see what I could get for some of it on ebay.\n\nFirst thing to sell: An old [Xbox 360](http://i.imgur.com/4CmyC.png) Falcon that was JTAGed. I threw it in the corner because I had to heat gun it to make it work but didn't want to throw it out because JTAG's are hard to get my hands on.\n\nWithin hours I got a [message inquiring about it.](http://imgur.com/I4Xr9). I called him on the number provided and explained that there was no accessories with it, apart from the power cable and an AV cord and he arranged to come and pick it up.\n\nAfter it was picked up I received another [message on ebay.](http://imgur.com/0HERQ) I was a little confused here, but decided that I would be somewhat professional in [my response](http://i.imgur.com/8KwU8.png) before I went to bed.\n\nAlas, when I awoke I had [several](http://i.imgur.com/Bidzq.png) [new](http://i.imgur.com/fi7b3.png) messages. He was not happy and now I was aware that he was a 'specel constable'.\n\nAt this point I started to consider that no matter how functionally inept this person was he could still make my life uncomfortable if he was telling the truth. I had honest doubts, for several reason I'm sure you understand. Through internet sleuthery I came across a facebook profile with not much visible except a picture of said officer in full uniform standing next to his police car. Goddamnit.\n\nThere was another [response](http://i.imgur.com/4rAg2.png) sent by yours truly and I'd decided to let it drop and not respond further. It was obvious that I felt I was being reasonable and he couldn't see that he was being an enormous dick, so talking more wasn't helping the situation.\n\nSince then I have received another [message](http://i.imgur.com/ym4st.png) implying that I have fallen into his cunningly hidden plot.\n\nThe last one is fun though, apparantly between the 31st of December and the 1st of January when I found it damn near impossible to get myself a cheeseburger from McDonalds he somehow managed to get an entire [time period](http://i.imgur.com/QqNVi.png) to accept a claim against me.\n\nBesides the fact that I now have a cop with a reason to dislike me, does anyone else find the fact that people with decision making capabilities such as these have such positions of authority as terrifying I do?\n\n**Edit:** Even though most communication is done via ebay, the sale itself was not. The listing was taken down due to the fact that ebay automagically listed my console as a \"Core Package\" which it was not. I obviously have no way to prove to you that I was honest in my dealing with him but I believe I made the situation very clear. He was originally happy to see it, knowing that it had an RROD problem because *he wanted it for the heat sinks only.* The other issues cropped up at a later date.\n\n**Edit2** Added a link to [my response.](http://i.imgur.com/8KwU8.png)\n\n**Edit3** I'm not entirely retarded, perhaps I didn't explain my correct level of skepticism that he was a police officer. I didn't go looking for information to see if he was a cop, I was 100% certain he was full of crap.

My girlfriend got on my case about it recently so I thought I&amp;#39;d see what I could get for some of it on ebay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First thing to sell: An old &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/4CmyC.png\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; Falcon that was JTAGed. I threw it in the corner because I had to heat gun it to make it work but didn&amp;#39;t want to throw it out because JTAG&amp;#39;s are hard to get my hands on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within hours I got a &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/I4Xr9\"&gt;message inquiring about it.&lt;/a&gt;. I called him on the number provided and explained that there was no accessories with it, apart from the power cable and an AV cord and he arranged to come and pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After it was picked up I received another &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/0HERQ\"&gt;message on ebay.&lt;/a&gt; I was a little confused here, but decided that I would be somewhat professional in &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/8KwU8.png\"&gt;my response&lt;/a&gt; before I went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alas, when I awoke I had &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Bidzq.png\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/fi7b3.png\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; messages. He was not happy and now I was aware that he was a &amp;#39;specel constable&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I started to consider that no matter how functionally inept this person was he could still make my life uncomfortable if he was telling the truth. I had honest doubts, for several reason I&amp;#39;m sure you understand. Through internet sleuthery I came across a facebook profile with not much visible except a picture of said officer in full uniform standing next to his police car. Goddamnit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was another &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/4rAg2.png\"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; sent by yours truly and I&amp;#39;d decided to let it drop and not respond further. It was obvious that I felt I was being reasonable and he couldn&amp;#39;t see that he was being an enormous dick, so talking more wasn&amp;#39;t helping the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I have received another &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ym4st.png\"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; implying that I have fallen into his cunningly hidden plot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last one is fun though, apparantly between the 31st of December and the 1st of January when I found it damn near impossible to get myself a cheeseburger from McDonalds he somehow managed to get an entire &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/QqNVi.png\"&gt;time period&lt;/a&gt; to accept a claim against me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides the fact that I now have a cop with a reason to dislike me, does anyone else find the fact that people with decision making capabilities such as these have such positions of authority as terrifying I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Even though most communication is done via ebay, the sale itself was not. The listing was taken down due to the fact that ebay automagically listed my console as a &amp;quot;Core Package&amp;quot; which it was not. I obviously have no way to prove to you that I was honest in my dealing with him but I believe I made the situation very clear. He was originally happy to see it, knowing that it had an RROD problem because &lt;em&gt;he wanted it for the heat sinks only.&lt;/em&gt; The other issues cropped up at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit2&lt;/strong&gt; Added a link to &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/8KwU8.png\"&gt;my response.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit3&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m not entirely retarded, perhaps I didn&amp;#39;t explain my correct level of skepticism that he was a police officer. I didn&amp;#39;t go looking for information to see if he was a cop, I was 100% certain he was full of crap.

Having seen the power of reddit to help those in need, I'm humbly asking for any assistance you might be able to render. :)\n\nSimply put, I need to find a guru. Obviously that term has a lot of definitions, but I'm hoping that through describing myself and what I'm trying to do that the type of person I'm looking for becomes clear.\n\nAbout me:\nI turn 30 this year. From the time I was about 13 (1994) until approximately November 2008, I suffered from a long, very dark depression. When I was around 15-16 I was hospitalized (twice on a outpatient basis, and once as a inpatient) for manic depression, suicidal tendencies, PTSD, anxiety, and other conditions fairly typical with that kind of diagnosis. Neither medication nor therapy helped, and eventually I abandoned the attempt. \nThe next 10+ years I lived as a husk of a human being -- I didn't care about anything (least of all taking care of myself), and my loved ones watched as my physical and mental health degenerated, unable to convince me to seek help. By the time I was 24, I had already lost a good amount of my hair, my weight soared above 300 lbs (I'm only average height, about 5'8\"), and (not surprisingly) hadn't been in any kind of relationship or even contact with the fairer sex since I'd graduated high school. The more time passed, the worse I would feel, and the more I would suffer. I'm sure anyone who has been depressed like this before can relate -- it's a vicious cycle, and I just felt (and looked) more monstrous every day.\n\nEventually, supported by a few very loving, understanding friends and family members, I began to get help from a great psychologist who specialized in cognitive therapy and EMDR. About six months after that I'd improved enough to begin to see a psychiatrist, and as we began to slowly find which medications helped me, and in what dosages, I finally turned the corner. Those of you who have been there know what I mean, but for me there was a realization one day. Being sick had kind of been like being under the water of a pool -- everything that had looked distorted and muddled from underneath suddenly was a lot clearer once my head was above the surface.\n\nIt's been a long road back, but as I got better I felt my old loves and interests returning. Physically, I've lost about 100 lbs so far (still want to lose about 50 more), my complexion has improved, and everyone notices I just look healthier (and I FEEL healthier, more importantly). I can't get back my lost time, and early on it was hard to not feel upset about it (in retrospect, it feels like the time was stolen from me), but I don't let it hold me back. The hardest thing to deal with was losing my hair -- by 28 my crown was completely hairless, and now at (almost) 30 I pretty much just have hair on the back and sides of my head (the horseshoe style so common with older men, haha).\n\nAs I got better, I reconnected with old interests and hobbies and passions. I was always a science guy -- despite being raised Catholic (or perhaps *because* I was raised Catholic) I was never religious. I'm still not religious, for those of you who might be worrying at this point that this is going to turn into one of those \"I found God, hallelujah\" testamonials. ;)\n\nAnyway, I got back into Cosmology, Astrophysics, quantum physics, neuroscience, and various other nerdy pursuits I used to have. One day I was browsing the free B&amp;N classics on my Nook and *Autobiography of a Yogi* popped up. Having read some metaphysics-y books when I was younger (Mom had some books on TM, Lucid Dreaming, Power of Positive Thinking, etc) I gave it a go. I'd recommend *Autobiography* to just about everyone, but as I read it, it really stimulated parts of my brain that hadn't gotten used since the late 90s. I began seeing similarities between a lot of the new research I'd been hearing about on TED regarding consciousness, the nature of reality, neuroscience, etc and some of the accounts in *Autobiography* (published in 1946 but takes place as far back as the early 1900s).\n\nBeing a science guy and not at all inclined to immediately accept one person's written account of some amazing phenomenon without question, I began reading voraciously. I read pretty much anything I could get my hands on regarding the current state of quantum physics, cosmology (specifically recent findings about dark matter, dark energy, WMAP, black holes, etc), neurology, psychology, yoga / yogic science (including Kriya), hinduism, buddhism, hermetic philosophy, etc.\n\nI realize that for many of my like-minded brethren, I have strayed into the heathen regions of pseudoscience, and as such, I do not expect everyone to share my enthusiasm for the blending of two so seemingly different fields of study. For me, I've heard enough on each side to be more or less convinced of the idea that there is some kind of link between certain metaphysical concepts and hard science.\n\nHere is the problem I've run into, though -- I seem to have reached a point (at least, for the moment) where I can't learn anything more through research and my questions are piling up. I feel like I can see a lot of the pieces, and I have an *idea* on how they fit together, but I also feel like I've reached the point where I should be asking for some guidance.\n\nThe trouble is that I've been unable to find someone who isn't polarized on one side or the other of the science / metaphysics argument. I've had no lack of people to discuss the scientific portion of my quest with, but many are unable or unwilling to discuss the issues outside of that particular framework. Likewise, I can find people with whom I can discuss the metaphysical parts of my research, but they often are not well read or familiar enough with the scientific side of things.\n\nIn short, I need someone who can talk about human nature, life, the nature of reality, philosophy, the mind, and the universe without going to one extreme or the other. If it will help, I can provide a list of the books I've read, as it might help illustrate the kinds of things I'm looking for answers on. Some of them were published pre-1900 so I don't know how many people here will have read them, but if you think it will help let me know.\n\nI don't necessarily expect to find someone on reddit, but maybe a friend of a friend, or even a friendly point in the right direction will be much appreciated! (I mean, come on, if reddit can get Stephen Colbert, how hard can this be, really? :P)\n\n\n**TL;DR** : I'm looking for an intelligent, well read, balance minded person to help guide me in my search for truth and meaning.
